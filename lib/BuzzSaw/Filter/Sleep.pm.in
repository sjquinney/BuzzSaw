=head1 NAME

BuzzSaw::Filter::Sleep - A BuzzSaw event filter for sleep log entries

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to BuzzSaw::Filter::Sleep version @LCFG_VERSION@

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   my $filter = BuzzSaw::Filter::Sleep->new();

   while ( defined( my $line = $fh->getline ) ) {
     my %event = $parser->parse_line($line);

     my ( $accept, @tags ) = $filter->check(\%event);

     if ($accept) {
        # store log entry in DB
     }
   }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a Moose class which provides a filter which implements the
BuzzSaw::Filter role. It is used to filter log entries and find those
associated with ACPI sleep. The module reports on
instances of ACPI acpi_sleep and acpi_wake. When an event is
accepted by the Sleep filter module it returns a C<sleep> tag along
with one of C<acpi_sleep> or C<acpi_wake>.

Note that this filter depends on the following two commands being
executed by the pm-utils package at the time of acpi_sleep or acpi_wake
respectively:

   /usr/bin/logger -t lcfg-sleep "Going to sleep"

   /usr/bin/logger -t lcfg-sleep "Waking up"

The BuzzSaw project provides a suite of tools for processing log file
entries. Entries in files are parsed and filtered into a set of events
of interest which are stored in a database. A report generation
framework is also available which makes it easy to generate regular
reports regarding the events discovered.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

There are no attributes in this class.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=over

=item ( $accept, @tags ) = $filter->check(\%event)

This method checks for log entries which are associated with sleep.
It does this by looking for lines where the
C<program> attribute is set to C<lcfg-sleep>. If that matches then it
looks to see if the message is "Waking up" or "Going to sleep".
If an event is accepted for storage then the
accept variable will be set to true and a set of tags will be returned
which contain C<sleep> and one of C<acpi_sleep> or C<acpi_wake>.
