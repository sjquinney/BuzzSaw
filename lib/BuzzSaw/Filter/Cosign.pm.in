=head1 NAME

BuzzSaw::Filter::Cosign - A BuzzSaw event filter for Cosign log entries

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to BuzzSaw::Filter::Cosign version @LCFG_VERSION@

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   my $filter = BuzzSaw::Filter::Cosign->new();

   while ( defined( my $line = $fh->getline ) ) {
     my %event = $parser->parse_line($line);

     my ( $accept, @tags ) = $filter->check(\%event);

     if ($accept) {
        # store log entry in DB
     }
   }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a Moose class which provides a filter which implements the
BuzzSaw::Filter role. It is used to filter log entries and find those
associated with the cosign daemon. An event will be accepted for
storage if it is related to a login being registered. When an event is
accepted by the Cosign filter module it returns C<cosign> and C<auth>
and C<auth_success> tags.

The BuzzSaw project provides a suite of tools for processing log file
entries. Entries in files are parsed and filtered into a set of events
of interest which are stored in a database. A report generation
framework is also available which makes it easy to generate regular
reports regarding the events discovered.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

There are no attributes in this class.
