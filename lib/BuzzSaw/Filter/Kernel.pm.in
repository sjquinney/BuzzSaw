=head1 NAME

BuzzSaw::Filter::Kernel - A BuzzSaw event filter for kernel log entries

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to BuzzSaw::Filter::Kernel version @LCFG_VERSION@

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   my $filter = BuzzSaw::Filter::Kernel->new();

   while ( defined( my $line = $fh->getline ) ) {
     my %event = $parser->parse_line($line);

     my ( $accept, @tags ) = $filter->check(\%event);

     if ($accept) {
        # store log entry in DB
     }
   }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a Moose class which provides a filter which implements the
BuzzSaw::Filter role. It is used to filter log entries and find those
associated with the Linux kernel. The module attempts to spot
important issues, it currently supports checking for segfaults,
Out-Of-Memory (OOM) issues, kernel panics and oops. When an event is
accepted by the Kernel filter module it returns a C<kernel> tag along
with one of C<segfault>, C<oops>, C<oom> or C<panic>.

The BuzzSaw project provides a suite of tools for processing log file
entries. Entries in files are parsed and filtered into a set of events
of interest which are stored in a database. A report generation
framework is also available which makes it easy to generate regular
reports regarding the events discovered.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

There are no attributes in this class.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=over

=item ( $accept, @tags ) = $filter->check(\%event)

This method checks for log entries which are associated with important
kernel issues. It does this by firstly looking for lines where the
C<program> attribute is set to C<kernel>. If that matches then it
looks checks the message to see if there is evidence of a segfault,
oom, oops or panic. If an event is accepted for storage then the
accept variable will be set to true and a set of tags will be returned
which contain C<kernel> and one of C<segfault>, C<oops>, C<oom> or
C<panic>.
