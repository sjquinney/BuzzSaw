=head1 NAME

BuzzSaw::Report::Sleep - Generate BuzzSaw reports about ACPI sleep events

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to BuzzSaw::Report::Sleep version @LCFG_VERSION@

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use BuzzSaw::Report::Sleep;

my $report = BuzzSaw::Report::Sleep->new(
                   email_to => 'fred@example.org',
                   start    => 'yesterday',
                   end      => 'today',
);

$report->generate();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides the functionality to search the BuzzSaw database
for log events related to ACPI sleep. It searches for log entries
corresponding to the start and the end of ACPI sleep on machines using
the LCFG sleep component.

The BuzzSaw project provides a suite of tools for processing log file
entries. Entries in files are parsed and filtered into a set of events
of interest which are stored in a database. A report generation
framework is also available which makes it easy to generate regular
reports regarding the events discovered.
