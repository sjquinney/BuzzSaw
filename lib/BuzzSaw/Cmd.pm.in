=head1 NAME

BuzzSaw::Cmd - Super-class for BuzzSaw command line applications

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to BuzzSaw::Cmd version @LCFG_VERSION@

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 package BuzzSaw::Cmd::Example;
 use Moose;

 extends 'BuzzSaw::Cmd';

 sub abstract { return q(Short help text for this app) }

 sub execute {
   my ( $self, $opt, $args ) = @_;

   ....
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a super-class that should be extended by each class which
represents a BuzzSaw command-line application. This class allows easy
handling of command-line options and automates the generation of short
usage documentation.

The BuzzSaw project provides a suite of tools for processing log file
entries. Entries in files are parsed and filtered into a set of events
of interest which are stored in a database. A report generation
framework is also available which makes it easy to generate regular
reports regarding the events discovered.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

There are no default attributes for this class. Any attributes you add
in a sub-class can be used as command-line options by applying the
C<Getopt> trait, see L<MooseX::Getopt> for details.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=item abstract
