=head1 NAME

BuzzSaw::DB::Schema - The BuzzSaw database schema class

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to BuzzSaw::DB::Schema version @LCFG_VERSION@

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use BuzzSaw::DB::Schema;

   my $schema
        = BuzzSaw::DB::Schema->connect( $dsn, $user, $pass, \%opts );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides access to the DBIx::Class layer which is used to
provide an interface to the BuzzSaw database.

The BuzzSaw project provides a suite of tools for processing log file
entries. Entries in files are parsed and filtered into a set of events
of interest which are stored in a database. A report generation
framework is also available which makes it easy to generate regular
reports regarding the events discovered.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

This class has one method:

=over

=item connect( $dsn, $user, $pass, \%options )

This takes the DBI Data Source Name (DSN) and, optionally, a username
and password to be used for connecting to the database. It can also
take a reference to a hash of options which control how the DBI layer
functions. A schema object is returned, see L<DBIx::Class::Schema> for
details of the available methods for this object.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

This class is not normally loaded directly, instead the
L<BuzzSaw::DB> module has support for retrieving the database
configuration parameters from a configuration file, see that module
for details.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

This module requires L<DBIx::Class>, you will also need a DBI driver
module such as L<DBD::Pg>.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<BuzzSaw>, L<BuzzSaw::DB>

=head1 PLATFORMS

This is the list of platforms on which we have tested this
software. We expect this software to work on any Unix-like platform
which is supported by Perl.
