=head1 NAME

BuzzSaw::Parser::RFC3339 - BuzzSaw parser for log entries with the RFC3339 dates

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to BuzzSaw::Parser::RFC3339 version @LCFG_VERSION@

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use BuzzSaw::Parser::RFC3339;

my $parser = BuzzSaw::Parser::RFC3339->new();

while (defined (my $line = $fh->getline) ) {
  my %event = $parser->parse_line($line);
}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a Moose class which provides a parser which implements the
BuzzSaw::Parser role. It can handle log entries that use the RFC3339
date format. The parser splits a line into separate parts, e.g. date,
program, pid, message.

The BuzzSaw project provides a suite of tools for processing log file
entries. Entries in files are parsed and filtered into a set of events
of interest which are stored in a database. A report generation
framework is also available which makes it easy to generate regular
reports regarding the events discovered.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

There are no attributes in this class.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=over

=item %results = $parser->parse_line($log_entry)

This method takes a log entry line as a string and returns a hash
which contains the details of the various parts of the entry.

The following date and time attributes will be specified in the
returned hash: C<year>, C<month>, C<day>, C<hour>, C<minute>,
C<second>. If a time-zone is specified in the log entry it will be
returned with the key C<time_zone>. These field names match with the
L<DateTime> attributes.

The C<message> attribute will always be defined (even if it is just an
empty string). The C<program> and C<pid> attributes are optional.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES
