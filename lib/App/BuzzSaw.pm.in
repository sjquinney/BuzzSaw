=head1 NAME

App::BuzzSaw - The BuzzSaw command-line application.

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to App::BuzzSaw version @LCFG_VERSION@

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module is not designed to be used directly. It is used by the
C<buzzsaw> command-line application. The command-line application
looks like:

  use App::BuzzSaw;

  App::BuzzSaw->run();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides the command-line interface handling for the
C<buzzsaw> command. It extends the L<MooseX::App::Cmd> class and
configures it to load application modules from the L<BuzzSaw::Cmd>
namespace. It allows the use of any unambiguous shortened version of a
longer application module name. For example, if the module is named
C<BuzzSaw::FooBar> you can call it as C<buzzsaw foo>.

The BuzzSaw project provides a suite of tools for processing log file
entries. Entries in files are parsed and filtered into a set of events
of interest which are stored in a database. A report generation
framework is also available which makes it easy to generate regular
reports regarding the events discovered.
