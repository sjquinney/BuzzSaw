2013-04-05  SVN: new release

	* Release: 0.12.0

2013-04-05 12:36  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* buzzsaw.sql: throw more indexes at the event table in a bid to
	  make reports quicker

2013-04-05 12:33  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lcfg.yml, lib/BuzzSaw/Report.pm.in,
	  lib/BuzzSaw/Report/Kernel.pm.in, lib/BuzzSaw/Report/Sleep.pm.in:
	  Added support for restricting report queries by the value of the
	  program field. This helps speed things up when the query might
	  return a lot of results. Also altered the default for the tags
	  list. This is now empty by default which makes a bit more sense
	  in most cases where the program field is set to the name of the
	  report. Reports should define the list of tags they want

	* ChangeLog, lcfg.yml: BuzzSaw release: 0.11.3

	  lib/BuzzSaw/Report.pm.in, templates/reports/sleep.tt: Completely

	  lib/BuzzSaw/Filter/UserClassifier.pm.in,
	  lib/BuzzSaw/Importer.pm.in: Reworked the voting system so that it

	  lib/BuzzSaw/Report/Kernel.pm.in, lib/BuzzSaw/Report/Sleep.pm.in:
	  Reworked how the default value for the report module tags list is

	  the name attribute. This avoids the possibility of the module
	  being given ALL events for the period to be processed when no
	  specific tag list has been set

2013-03-15 09:57  cc@INF.ED.AC.UK

	  Also added documentation for the module

2013-03-14 15:16  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lib/BuzzSaw/Filter/Cosign.pm.in, lib/BuzzSaw/Filter/SSH.pm.in,

2013-03-14 15:11  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	  Now anything returning a true value will have the tags retained
	  but the entry (and tags) will only be stored if one or more
	  filter returns a positive value. This change helps
	  post-processing where we need tags to be retained but do not want
	  to alter the current state of the votes

	* lib/BuzzSaw/Report.pm.in: Made it much simpler to add new

2013-03-14 14:07  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lib/BuzzSaw/Importer.pm.in: Tweaked slightly so that when calling
	  a filter the current number of votes and the results of the
	  previous filters are passed in. This makes it much easier to do
	  post-processing (such as user classification)

2013-03-14 14:06  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lib/BuzzSaw/Filter/UserClassifier.pm.in,

	  filename in the list is selected so that more work is done in a
	  single query in the DB. This is cleaner and should be more
	  efficient

2012-07-02 16:01  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lib/BuzzSaw/DB.pm.in: reworked the start_processing method to use
	  the new version of the register_current_processing DB function

2012-07-02 15:58  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* buzzsaw.sql: altered the register_current_processing function so

	* lib/BuzzSaw/Filter/Auth.pm.in, lib/BuzzSaw/Filter/Kernel.pm.in:
	  Added 'o' flag to some regular expressions to hopefully make them
	  a little bit faster

2012-07-02 09:15  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* ChangeLog, lcfg.yml: BuzzSaw release: 0.2.0

2012-07-02 09:07  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	  the same files at the same time

2012-06-29 15:52  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* buzzsaw.sql: Added new table for tracking the file currently
