2012-07-06 15:38  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lib/BuzzSaw/DateTime.pm.in: fixed timezone handling

2012-07-06 15:08  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lib/BuzzSaw/Report.pm.in: Do not prefetch tags for each event as
	  it messes things up at a later stage

2012-07-06 14:49  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lib/BuzzSaw/Report/Kernel.pm.in: process the events into separate
	  sets based on the tag names

2012-07-06 14:28  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lib/BuzzSaw/Report.pm.in: Need to load the BuzzSaw::DB module

	* lib/BuzzSaw/Report.pm.in, lib/BuzzSaw/Report/Kernel.pm.in:
	  Further work on the report generation process

2012-07-06 12:05  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lcfg.yml, lib/BuzzSaw/Report, lib/BuzzSaw/Report.pm.in,
	  lib/BuzzSaw/Report/Kernel.pm.in: Made a start on a report
	  generator framework

2012-07-06 12:05  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lib/BuzzSaw/DateTime.pm.in: Added new module to handle dates.
	  This is a sub-class of the DateTime module with one extra method,
	  named from_date_string, which can parse various extra date
	  strings which are supported by the Linux audit framework

2012-07-06 12:04  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lib/BuzzSaw/DB.pm.in: Added support for setting attributes from a
	  configuration file using MooseX::SimpleConfig

2012-07-04 15:40  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lib/BuzzSaw/DataSource/Files.pm.in: Removed debug code to make
	  things quieter

2012-07-04 15:37  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lib/BuzzSaw/DB.pm.in: Removed debug code to make things quieter

2012-07-04 15:25  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lib/BuzzSaw/DB.pm.in: Added missing schema variable

2012-07-04 15:24  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lib/BuzzSaw/DB.pm.in: Reworked check_log_seen to work directly
	  with the DBI layer. This should make things quicker

2012-07-04 15:18  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lcfg.yml, lib/BuzzSaw/Parser/RFC3339.pm.in: Completely reworked
	  the parser. This should be correct more of the time and it's
	  better at guessing the name/pid for programs. It should also be
	  slightly faster as the regular expressions are no longer
	  recompiled on every call to the subroutine.

2012-07-02 16:32  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lib/BuzzSaw/DB.pm.in: Adjusted some debugging so it is clearer
	  why a file is not going to be processed

2012-07-02 16:25  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lcfg.yml, lib/BuzzSaw/DB.pm.in,
	  lib/BuzzSaw/DataSource/Files.pm.in: Fixed scoping issue in the
	  _next_filename method

2012-07-02 16:14  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lib/BuzzSaw/DataSource/Files.pm.in: changed order in BUILD to
	  avoid files list being unnecessarily calculated twice

2012-07-02 16:04  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lib/BuzzSaw/DataSource/Files.pm.in: Reworked the way the next
	  filename in the list is selected so that more work is done in a
	  single query in the DB. This is cleaner and should be more
	  efficient

2012-07-02 16:01  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lib/BuzzSaw/DB.pm.in: reworked the start_processing method to use
	  the new version of the register_current_processing DB function

2012-07-02 15:58  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* buzzsaw.sql: altered the register_current_processing function so
	  that it also does the checking of the previously seen logs table,
	  this should be safer and more efficient

2012-07-02 15:10  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lib/BuzzSaw/DataSource/Files.pm.in: Randomised the order of the
	  files found to try and make things slightly more efficient

2012-07-02 14:48  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	  for matching the file names

	* ChangeLog, lcfg.yml: BuzzSaw release: 0.2.1

2012-07-02 10:20  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

2012-07-02 10:15  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lib/BuzzSaw/Filter/Auth.pm.in, t, t/00_use.t: Added basic
	  compilation tests

2012-07-02 09:55  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lib/BuzzSaw/Filter/Auth.pm.in, lib/BuzzSaw/Filter/Kernel.pm.in:
	  Added 'o' flag to some regular expressions to hopefully make them
	  a little bit faster

2012-07-02 09:15  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* ChangeLog, lcfg.yml: BuzzSaw release: 0.2.0

2012-07-02 09:07  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lib/BuzzSaw/DataSource/Files.pm.in: Reworked slightly how we
	  check if the next filename is already being processed

2012-07-01 20:57  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lib/BuzzSaw/DataSource/Files.pm.in: First attempt at marking the
	  beginning and end of processing

	* lib/BuzzSaw/DB.pm.in,
	  lib/BuzzSaw/DB/Schema/Result/CurrentProcessing.pm.in: Added
	  support for registering that processing of a file has
	  started/ended. This will help multiple processors avoid parsing
	  the same files at the same time

2012-06-29 15:52  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* buzzsaw.sql: Added new table for tracking the file currently
	  being processed. Also added a function which will query this
	  table with locking and timeout support

2012-06-28 15:54  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lib/BuzzSaw/DataSource/Files.pm.in: Call begin_transaction on the
	  correct object this time

2012-06-28 15:48  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* ChangeLog, lcfg.yml: BuzzSaw release: 0.1.1

2012-06-28 15:26  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lib/BuzzSaw/Catalogue.pm.in, lib/BuzzSaw/DB.pm.in,
	  lib/BuzzSaw/DataSource/Files.pm.in: Added support for using
	  transactions with the database. Use the new transaction functions
	  so that we are not committing changes quite so frequently
