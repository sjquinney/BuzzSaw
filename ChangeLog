	* Release: 0.2.0

2012-07-02 09:07  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lib/BuzzSaw/DataSource/Files.pm.in: Reworked slightly how we
	  check if the next filename is already being processed

2012-07-01 20:57  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lib/BuzzSaw/DataSource/Files.pm.in: First attempt at marking the
	  beginning and end of processing

	* lib/BuzzSaw/DB.pm.in: Fixed function name

2012-06-29 16:17  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lib/BuzzSaw/DB.pm.in,
	  lib/BuzzSaw/DB/Schema/Result/CurrentProcessing.pm.in: Added
	  support for registering that processing of a file has
	  started/ended. This will help multiple processors avoid parsing
	  the same files at the same time

2012-06-29 15:52  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* buzzsaw.sql: Added new table for tracking the file currently
	  being processed. Also added a function which will query this
	  table with locking and timeout support

	* lib/BuzzSaw/DataSource/Files.pm.in: Call begin_transaction on the
	  correct object this time

	* lib/BuzzSaw/Catalogue.pm.in, lib/BuzzSaw/DB.pm.in,
	  lib/BuzzSaw/DataSource/Files.pm.in: Added support for using
	  transactions with the database. Use the new transaction functions
	  so that we are not committing changes quite so frequently
