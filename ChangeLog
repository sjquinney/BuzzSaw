	  filename in the list is selected so that more work is done in a
	  single query in the DB. This is cleaner and should be more
	  efficient

2012-07-02 16:01  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lib/BuzzSaw/DB.pm.in: reworked the start_processing method to use

	* lib/BuzzSaw/Filter/Auth.pm.in, lib/BuzzSaw/Filter/Kernel.pm.in:
	  Added 'o' flag to some regular expressions to hopefully make them
	  a little bit faster

2012-07-02 09:15  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* ChangeLog, lcfg.yml: BuzzSaw release: 0.2.0

2012-07-02 09:07  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	  the same files at the same time

2012-06-29 15:52  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK
