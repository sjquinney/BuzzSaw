    <h1>BuzzSaw - Database</h1>

    <h2>Schema</h2>
    <p>At the heart of the design of the BuzzSaw database schema is a
    representation of a log message as an <em>event</em>, associated
    with each event are zero or more <em>tags</em> and zero or more
    pieces of <em>extra_info</em>.</p>

    <p>The database schema also contains tables which are used for
    tracking data sources to help avoid parsing the sources multiple
    times. There are also tables available which can be used to
    provide locking facilities so that multiple importer processes can
    be run concurrently without risk of conflicts.</p>

    <h3>Events</h3>

    <p>Each log message is modelled as an <em>event</em> and is stored
    in the table of that name. The attributes for the <em>event</em>
    table are as follows:</p>

    <table border="1">
      <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Nullable</th>
        <th>Purpose</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>id</td>
        <td>Integer. Must be unique.</td>
        <td>No</td>
        <td>Primary Key</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>raw</td>
        <td>String (max length 1000 chars).</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
        <td>The full original log message.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>digest</td>
        <td>Base64 encoded string (max length 200 chars). Must be unique.</td>
        <td>No</td>
        <td>The Base64 encoded digest of the full original log message.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>logtime</td>
        <td>Timestamp.</td>
        <td>No</td>
        <td>The full timestamp (date and time) with timezone for the log message. Must not be null.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>logdate</td>
        <td>Date</td>
        <td>No</td>
        <td>The date part of the timestamp, automatically extracted by a database trigger.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>hostname</td>
        <td>String (max length 100 chars).</td>
        <td>No</td>
        <td>The name of the host from which the log message originated.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>message</td>
        <td>String (max length 1000 chars).</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
        <td>The extracted log message (timestamp, hostname, program, etc. have been removed).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>program</td>
        <td>String (max length 100 chars).</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
        <td>The name of the program (e.g. sshd) which generated the log message. Not always recorded in the log message.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>pid</td>
        <td>Integer</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
        <td>The process ID of the program which generated the log message. Not always recorded in the log message.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>userid</td>
        <td>String (max length 20 chars).</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
        <td>The ID of the user associated with this log message. Often this is not recorded in the log message. It might be a string username or an integer UID.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>If you need to do queries based on dates and you are not interested in the times then you definitely want to use the <code>logdate</code> column, it is much faster.</p>

    <h3>Tags</h3>

    <p>Associated with each <em>event</em> are zero or more tags. A
    tag is a simple label
    (e.g. <em>auth_failure</em>, <em>segfault</em>) which describes
    some aspect of the log message. The attributes for
    the <em>tag</em> table are as follows:</p>

    <table border="1">
      <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Nullable</th>
        <th>Purpose</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>id</td>
        <td>Integer. Must be unique.</td>
        <td>No</td>
        <td>Primary Key</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>name</td>
        <td>String (max length 20 chars).</td>
        <td>No</td>
        <td>The name of the label.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>event</td>
        <td>Integer.</td>
        <td>No</td>
        <td>Foreign key reference to the event table</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Extra Information</h3>

    <p>Associated with each <em>event</em> are zero or more pieces of
    extra information. Extra information has both an arbitrary name
    and a value which describes some aspect of the log message
    (e.g. the source_address of an SSH login). The attributes for
    the <em>extra_info</em> table are as follows:</p>

    <table border="1">
      <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Nullable</th>
        <th>Purpose</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>id</td>
        <td>Integer. Must be unique.</td>
        <td>No</td>
        <td>Primary Key</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>name</td>
        <td>String (max length 20 chars).</td>
        <td>No</td>
        <td>The name of the extra information.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>val</td>
        <td>String (max length 100 chars).</td>
        <td>No</td>
        <td>The value of the extra information.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>event</td>
        <td>Integer.</td>
        <td>No</td>
        <td>Foreign key reference to the event table</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Note that when old entries in the events table are anonymised
    that all extra information associated with an event is
    deleted. Contrast this with the tags table where they are all
    kept, it is assumed that all tags are &quot;safe&quot;.</p>
