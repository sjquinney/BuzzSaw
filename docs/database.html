    <h1>BuzzSaw - Database</h1>

    <h2>Schema</h2>
    <p>At the heart of the design of the BuzzSaw database schema is a
    representation of a log message as an <em>event</em>, associated
    with each event are zero or more <em>tags</em> and zero or more
    pieces of <em>extra_info</em>.</p>

    <p>The database schema also contains tables which are used for
    tracking data sources to help avoid parsing the sources multiple
    times. There are also tables available which can be used to
    provide locking facilities so that multiple importer processes can
    be run concurrently without risk of conflicts.</p>

    <h3>Events</h3>

    <p>Each log message is modelled as an <em>event</em> and is stored
    in the table of that name. The attributes for the <em>event</em>
    table are as follows:</p>

    <table border="1">
      <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Nullable</th>
        <th>Purpose</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>id</td>
        <td>Integer. Must be unique.</td>
        <td>No</td>
        <td>Primary Key</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>raw</td>
        <td>String (max length 1000 chars).</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
        <td>The full original log message.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>digest</td>
        <td>Base64 encoded string (max length 200 chars). Must be unique.</td>
        <td>No</td>
        <td>The Base64 encoded digest of the full original log message.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>logtime</td>
        <td>Timestamp.</td>
        <td>No</td>
        <td>The full timestamp (date and time) with timezone for the log message. Must not be null.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>logdate</td>
        <td>Date</td>
        <td>No</td>
        <td>The date part of the timestamp, automatically extracted by a database trigger.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>hostname</td>
        <td>String (max length 100 chars).</td>
        <td>No</td>
        <td>The name of the host from which the log message originated.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>message</td>
        <td>String (max length 1000 chars).</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
        <td>The extracted log message (timestamp, hostname, program, etc. have been removed).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>program</td>
        <td>String (max length 100 chars).</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
        <td>The name of the program (e.g. sshd) which generated the log message. Not always recorded in the log message.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>pid</td>
        <td>Integer</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
        <td>The process ID of the program which generated the log message. Not always recorded in the log message.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>userid</td>
        <td>String (max length 20 chars).</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
        <td>The ID of the user associated with this log message. Often this is not recorded in the log message. It might be a string username or an integer UID.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>If you need to do queries based on dates and you are not interested in the times then you definitely want to use the <code>logdate</code> column, it is much faster.</p>

    <h3>Tags</h3>

    <p>Associated with each <em>event</em> are zero or more tags. A
    tag is a simple label
    (e.g. <em>auth_failure</em>, <em>segfault</em>) which describes
    some aspect of the log message. The attributes for
    the <em>tag</em> table are as follows:</p>

    <table border="1">
      <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Nullable</th>
        <th>Purpose</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>id</td>
        <td>Integer. Must be unique.</td>
        <td>No</td>
        <td>Primary Key</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>name</td>
        <td>String (max length 20 chars).</td>
        <td>No</td>
        <td>The name of the label.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>event</td>
        <td>Integer.</td>
        <td>No</td>
        <td>Foreign key reference to the event table</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Extra Information</h3>

    <p>Associated with each <em>event</em> are zero or more pieces of
    extra information. Extra information has both an arbitrary name
    and a value which describes some aspect of the log message
    (e.g. the source_address of an SSH login). The attributes for
    the <em>extra_info</em> table are as follows:</p>

    <table border="1">
      <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Nullable</th>
        <th>Purpose</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>id</td>
        <td>Integer. Must be unique.</td>
        <td>No</td>
        <td>Primary Key</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>name</td>
        <td>String (max length 20 chars).</td>
        <td>No</td>
        <td>The name of the extra information.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>val</td>
        <td>String (max length 100 chars).</td>
        <td>No</td>
        <td>The value of the extra information.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>event</td>
        <td>Integer.</td>
        <td>No</td>
        <td>Foreign key reference to the event table</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Note that when old entries in the events table are anonymised
    that all extra information associated with an event is
    deleted. Contrast this with the tags table where they are all
    kept, it is assumed that all tags are &quot;safe&quot;.</p>

    <h2>The BuzzSaw::DB API</h2>

    <p>When you need to make arbitrary buzzsaw database queries you
    could just use SQL (with or without the perl DBI interface) and
    that will give you everything you need. However there is a handy
    API based on the excellent Perl <code>DBIx::Class</code> module
    which can make creating complex queries much simpler. This API is
    exposed via the <code>BuzzSaw::DB</code> module. It can be used
    like this:</p>

<pre>
   use BuzzSaw::DB;

   my $db = BuzzSaw::DB->new( name => 'logdb',
                              user => 'fred',
                              pass => 'letmein' );

   my $schema = $db->schema;

   my @events = $schema->resultset('Event')->search( { hostname => 'foo' } );
</pre>

    <p>More typically you will not want to specify the user
    credentials in the script itself so the better approach is to use
    a configuration file. That can be done like this:</p>

<pre>
   use BuzzSaw::DB;

   my $db = BuzzSaw::DB->new_with_config();

   my $schema = $db->schema;
</pre>

<p>The default configuration file is <code>/etc/buzzsaw/db.yaml</code>
but it can be overridden like so:</p>

<pre>
   use BuzzSaw::DB;

   my $db = BuzzSaw::DB->new_with_config( configfile => 'buzzsaw_db.yaml' );

   my $schema = $db->schema;
</pre>

<p>The format of the configuration file must be YAML. It is a simple
hash of key-value pairs which map to the various attributes in
the <code>BuzzSaw::DB</code> module (e.g. user, pass, name, host,
port).</p>

<p>As shown above, to get access to the <code>DBIx::Class</code>
schema object you need to use the <code>schema</code> accessor. There
are result set classes available for all DB tables (named <code>Event</code>, <code>Tag</code>,
<code>ExtraInfo</code>, <code>Log</code>
and <code>CurrentProcessing</code>). These result sets are used for
querying the entries in the table. The parameters of an entry in the
result set can be easily queried through the accessors. Here's an
example:</p>

<pre>
   my $schema = $db->schema;

   my @events = $schema->resultset('Event')->search( { hostname => 'foo' } );

   for my $event (@events) {
      my $time = $event->logtime;
      my $program = $event->program;

      print "$time $program\n";
   }
</pre>

<p>The full details for each result set can be found by looking at the
perl docs for the modules, they are in
the <code>BuzzSaw::DB::Schema::Result</code> namespace
(e.g. <code>BuzzSaw::DB::Schema::Result::Event</code>).</p>

<p>Thanks to <code>DBIx::Class</code> it is possible to easily
retrieve the data associated with an event which is stored in a
foreign table (e.g. <em>tags</em> and <em>extra_info</em>). Here is an
example of retrieving the tags for an event:</p>

<pre>
  for my $event (@events) {

    my @tags = $event->search_related('tags')->all;

  }
</pre>
