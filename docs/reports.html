    <h1>BuzzSaw - Reports</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>As well as being able to execute adhoc queries as required an
    administrator often needs to be able to run regular reports which
    analyse and summarise particular types of events which have
    occurred within a given period. These might be hourly, daily,
    weekly or monthly, all of which can be handled using
    the <code>BuzzSaw::Reporter</code> module.</p>

    <p>The reporter module can be run in one of two modes. It can
    either be run at specific times (e.g. fron cron) and just execute
    reports of a certain required type (e.g. hourly). Or alternatively
    it can be run for all types and it will generate all reports which
    have not been run within the specified period (e.g. if a weekly
    report was last generated more than 7 days ago). The last report
    generation time is recorded so either mode will work.</p>

    <p>Typically reports will be generated using the buzzsaw
    command-line tool like this:</p>

<pre>
buzzsaw report --all hourly
</pre>

<p>For full details on the supported options view the help page for the
command like this:</p>

<pre>
buzzsaw help report
</pre>

<p>One particularly useful flag is <code>--debug</code> which will
display a lot more information on stdout.</p>

<p>The report command is configured via
the <code>/etc/buzzsaw/reporter.yaml</code> file, that is typically
managed using the LCFG buzzsaw component but could also be hand edited
for one-off requirements (e.g. for testing new reports).</p>

<h2>Writing a new Report Module</h2>

<h3>First Steps</h3>

<p>If you need to generate a report based on tags of a specific name
then it is possible to just do this using the
generic <code>BuzzSaw::Report</code> module. That is often the best
starting point when you are needing to develop a completely new
report. You can do something like the following as a simple
script:</p>

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl                                                                 
use strict;
use warnings;

use BuzzSaw::Report;

my $report = BuzzSaw::Report->new( name => 'FooBar' );

$report->add_tmpldir("$ENV{HOME}/buzzsaw_templates");

$report->generate();
</pre>

<p>This will find all events which occurred during the previous day
(the default date range) which were tagged as the lower-cased version
of the report name (e.g. <code>foobar</code>). A report will be
generated (and printed to stdout) using a template which has a name
based on the lower-cased version of the report name with
a <code>.tt</code> suffix (e.g. <code>foobar.tt</code>). That template
will need to exist within one of the default template directories
(<code>/usr/share/buzzsaw/templates/reports</code>
or <code>/usr/share/buzzsaw/templates</code>) or your
own <code>buzzsaw_templates</code> directory which you will need to
create if required. Any template you put into
your <code>buzzsaw_templates</code> directory will override a template
of the same name in any of the default template directories. That
makes it simple to test new developments to existing templates.</p>

<h3>Writing a template</h3>

<p>The template processing stage is carried out by
the <code>process_template</code> method. This creates a new Template
Toolkit object and passes in various data to the template
processor. The following parameters are available in your
template:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>events</dt>
  <dd>A reference to an array of events which matched the query.</dd>
  <dt>results</dt>
  <dd>A reference to a hash of data returned by
  the <code>process_events</code> method (empty by default).</dd>
  <dt>params</dt>
  <dd>Parameters set when the report object was created. Currently this is the values for the <em>start</em>, <em>end</em> and <em>tags</em> attributes.</dd>
</dl>

<p>A simple template might look like this:</p>

<pre>
% FOREACH e IN events -%]
[% e.hostname %],[% e.logtime %],[% e.message %]
[% END -%]
</pre>

<p>That will just print out a list of the comma-separated values of
the hostname, timestamps and messages for each event which matched
during the specified period.</p>

<p>The Template Toolkit is a fairly powerful tool for mangling output
so it is well worth reading the <code>Template::Manual</code>.</p>

<h3>Sending Email</h3>

<p>By default the report will be printed to stdout. That is fine when
testing new code but not much use if you need to generate reports on a
regular basis. The alternative is to get the report sent by
email. This is done trivially by setting a value for
the <code>email_to</code> attribute. For example:</p>

<pre>
my $report = BuzzSaw::Report->new( name     => 'FooBar',
                                   email_to => 'fred@example.org' );
</pre>

<p>More typically this is done by setting parameters in the reporter
configuration file. That is usually done using the buzzsaw component
resource <code>report_email_to_</code><em>tag</em> for the particular
report <em>tag</em> resource.</p>

<p>You can send email to as many addresses as you like by using a
reference to an array instead of a string. The first address in the
list goes into the <em>To</em> field and the rest are added in
the <em>Cc</em> field. You can also control the <em>From</em> address
using the <code>email_from</code> attribute and the <em>Subject</em>
using the <code>email_subject</code> attribute.</p>

<h3>Creating a module</h3>

<p>Once you have created a new report the preferred deployment method
is to create a report module and get it and the template file added to
the BuzzSaw distribution.</p>

<p>A simple module would look like this:</p>

<pre>
package BuzzSaw::Report::FooBar;

use Moose;

extends 'BuzzSaw::Report';

no Moose;
__PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable;

1;
</pre>

<p>The name of the report is now taken from the final part of the
module name (i.e. <code>FooBar</code>). When
the <code>generate()</code> method is called this module will generate
exactly the same report as the previous example (events in the
previous day tagged as <code>foobar</code>). The only difference is
that the template (<code>foobar.tt</code>) now needs to be in one of
the standard template directories. With the module in place it can be
added to one of the report lists in the configuration for
the <code>BuzzSaw::Reporter</code> module.</p>

<h3>More complex reports</h3>

<p>Occasionally it is necessary to analyse the data before generating
the report or it might not be possible to do certain processing of the
event data in the template. In this case a sub-class of
the <code>BuzzSaw::Report</code> module is essential. The most
appropriate way to do this is to override
the <code>process_events</code> method which by default does nothing.

<p>You need to do something like this in your sub-class:</p>

<pre>
override 'process_events' => sub {
  my ( $self, @events ) = @_;

  my %results;
  for my $event (@events) {
    # do some processing...
    # stuff data in %results hash...
  }

  return %results;
};
</pre>

<p>Tip: watch out for that obligatory trailing semi-colon. A good
example of processing the events data in this way can be found in the
Kernel report.</p>
