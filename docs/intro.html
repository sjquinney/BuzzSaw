    <h1>BuzzSaw - Overview</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>The School of Informatics has approximately 1100 managed Linux
    machines which, since the upgrade to the SL6 platform, send a copy
    of all syslog messages over the network to a central log
    server. The central log server is primarily intended as a secure
    medium-term storage location for all system messages. This avoids
    the potential for data loss when the security of a system is
    compromised or a system crashes before all data can be written to
    local storage. A secondary benefit of this centralised log storage
    is that it makes it possible to easily search for interesting data
    across multiple hosts and over long time periods. When system log
    messages are only held locally on a machine it is typically quite
    awkward to execute large-scale queries across many hosts. It is
    also the case that data is often only held for short periods due
    to disk space constraints.</p>

    <p>The BuzzSaw project was developed to take advantage of the
    goldmine of data which became available with the introduction of
    centralised storage. The log messages are stored on disk in
    separate directories for each machine and rotated daily so clearly
    it would be possible to do a certain amount of data analysis using
    basic command-line text processing tools (e.g. awk, grep,
    sort). This simple approach rapidly breaks down though once you
    need to do more complex queries based on information which is
    derived from certain types of messages (e.g. username or source IP
    address). It is also non-trivial to restrict queries to date and
    time ranges using this processing method. Using these command-line
    tools has many advantages, it is easy and quick to filter files
    for messages which match strings and requires no extra skills or
    knowledge. Any advanced data-analysis system must be similarly
    straightforward to use whilst providing the extra features
    necessary to fully explore the depths of the data.</p>

    <p>There are many system log processing tools available, both
    open-source and proprietary. Having examined a few of the options
    it was clear that most are large, complex projects which provide
    vastly more features than are required by Informatics. This makes
    them difficult to comprehend or configure. There were also issues
    related to installation and management which meant we felt they
    were not a good match to our systems. It was thus decided that we
    would develop software internally which could parse, filter and
    store the data of interest from the system logs. We also required
    a framework for report generation but the intention was that users
    would not be tied into any particular single solution for report
    generation. These requirements were developed into the BuzzSaw
    project.</p>

    <h2><a name="philosophy">Design Philosophy</a></h2>

    <h3>Store only the interesting data</h3>

    <p>The rsyslog daemon running on the central log server is doing a
    very good job of storing the complete set of system log messages
    for each machine into files. This is a lightweight and simple
    approach which guarantees a high degree of reliability. From
    examining the data it was clear that most of it is of little
    interest to us on a daily basis. For example, on a busy SSH server
    the ssh daemon authentication data that we actually wish to
    analyse only constitutes 10% of the entire daily system logs. With
    this in mind we decided to develop a data importing pipeline which
    could process the log messages stored in the files on a regular
    basis (hourly, daily, weekly, as necessary) and filter out the
    data of interest for storage in a separate database. The aim was
    that the design should not prevent the addition, at some later
    date, of a facility to import log messages &quot;live&quot; from
    the incoming stream of messages but that this would not be
    necessary.</p>

    <h3>Avoid unnecessarily parsing messages and files multiple times</h3>

    <p>The log rotation and compression system we have in place means
    that log files frequently change names. To avoid excessive
    processing time and minimise computing resource consumption, any
    log processing system should be intelligent enough to avoid
    reprocessing files where only the file name has been
    altered. Similarly, if the file compression level has changed (but
    not the actual true content) then log messages should not be
    parsed more than once.</p>

    <h3>Allow reprocessing of the log messages</h3>

    <p>Clearly if the approach is to ignore a large percentage of the
    log messages and avoid reparsing previously seen messages then
    occasionally a need to re-process the log files will occur. This
    is most likely when an administrator has a new requirement to
    analyse data related to some facility and generate long-term
    statistics. It should be possible to go back through the system
    logs and import more log messages where required.</p>

    <h3>A single, straightforward query mechanism</h3>

    <p>It should be possible to query all the data using a single,
    straightforward query mechanism. The most obvious solution was to
    import the data of interest into an SQL database. This means that
    administrators can query the data directly using the SQL language
    which is relatively simple, well understood and well
    documented. As well as being a very powerful query language, this
    has significant advantages over the command-line tool approach in
    that it is not necessary to know the syntax for multiple different
    tools (e.g. awk, grep, sed). The additional benefit is that
    querying SQL databases is extremely well supported in most
    programming languages (e.g. using DBI in Perl and psycopg2 in
    Python).</p>

    <h3>Support multiple data sources</h3>

    <p>Currently we only have syslog style logs stored on our central
    log server but there is no technical reason not to aggregate logs
    from other services (e.g. apache). Consequently there must be the
    option to import from multiple different sources. There should
    also be no restrictions on the storage formats of the raw data. It
    should be possible to process raw data from any file type, process
    a live stream or work with an external database if required.</p>

    <h3>Support parsing multiple formats</h3>

    <p>With our current rsyslog configuration the log messages have
    the date and time formatted as an RFC3339 timestamp. Other logging
    systems (e.g. apache) use different timestamp formats and at some
    point in the future we may wish to alter our chosen format. This
    leads to the requirement that it should be possible to have the
    log messages from different sources parsed in different ways.</p>

    <h3>Support flexible filtering and processing</h3>

    <p>The way in which filtering is done must be flexible and must
    allow the administrator to easily configure the stack of filters
    and the sequence in which they are applied. It must be possible to
    have as many (or as few) filters as necessary. It must also be
    possible for the filters to modify and extend the data associated
    with log messages of interest. It should be possible to use the
    same filter multiple times in a stack. Filters should be able to
    see which filters have already been run and process the results
    from those filters as well as the raw data itself. This would
    allow, for instance, a user name classifier filter to work on user
    names discovered by various filters earlier in the stack (e.g. SSH
    and Cosign).</p>

    <p>It must be straightforward and relatively simple to develop new
    filters to select the log messages of interest. If possible there
    should be support for using a generic filter module with a
    specific set of configuration parameters to avoid the need to
    write new code in simple situations.</p>

    <h3>Provide a report generation framework</h3>

    <p>Although it should be possible to generate reports in any
    desirable manner using SQL queries there should also be a standard
    report generation framework. This would provide an easy to use
    interface which handles the most common situations.</p>

    <p>The reporting framework must use a standard template system. It
    should be possible to send the results to stdout or by email to
    multiple addresses. It should be possible to generate multiple
    formats, for example html web pages, as well as text.</p>

    <p>Typically an administrator needs to generate reports on a
    regular basis (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly) so those types of
    recurring reports must be supported.</p>

    <p>It must be straightforward and relatively simple to develop new
    reports. If possible there should be support for using a generic
    report module with a specific set of configuration parameters to
    avoid the need to write new code in simple situations.</p>
